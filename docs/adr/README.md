# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architectural Decision Records for the Work Timer application. These documents capture the key architectural decisions made during the development process, including the context, rationale, and consequences of each decision.

## ADR Index

### [ADR-0001: Domain-Driven Design Architecture](./0001-domain-driven-design-architecture.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024

Describes the decision to implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture with clear layer separation to handle complex business logic and improve maintainability.

**Key Points**:
- Transition from simple service-based architecture to DDD
- Four-layer architecture: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation
- Implementation of ubiquitous language and bounded contexts
- Migration strategy from legacy architecture

### [ADR-0002: Angular Signals for State Management](./0002-angular-signals-state-management.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024

Documents the adoption of Angular Signals as the primary state management solution, replacing Observable-based patterns for improved performance and simplicity.

**Key Points**:
- Real-time state management with automatic change detection
- Integration with OnPush change detection strategy
- Performance benefits over Observable-based solutions
- Simplified component development and testing

### [ADR-0003: CQRS Pattern Implementation](./0003-cqrs-pattern-implementation.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024

Explains the implementation of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to separate read and write operations in the application layer.

**Key Points**:
- Clear separation between commands and queries
- Business logic encapsulation in command handlers
- Optimized query handlers for read operations
- Integration with domain events and repository pattern

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use the following template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Rationale
[Why are we making this decision? What are the benefits?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]

## Alternatives Considered
[What other options were considered and why were they rejected?]

## References
[Links to external resources, documentation, or related decisions]
```

## Decision Process

1. **Identify the Need**: Recognize when an architectural decision needs to be documented
2. **Research Options**: Investigate different approaches and their trade-offs
3. **Document Decision**: Create an ADR following the template
4. **Review and Discuss**: Share with team for feedback and validation
5. **Accept or Revise**: Finalize the decision or iterate based on feedback
6. **Implement**: Execute the decision and update related documentation

## Governance

- ADRs should be created for any significant architectural decision
- All team members should review and understand relevant ADRs
- ADRs should be updated when decisions are superseded or deprecated
- Regular review of ADRs ensures they remain current and accurate
